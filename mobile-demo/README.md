# Options Risk Check Mobile Demo

Clickable Expo React Native prototype for the Options Risk Check app.

This version is still a local demo, but it is structured like a real app. The screens use mock-backed service functions today, so the FastAPI backend can be connected screen by screen later.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run web
```

Open the Expo web URL in a browser. The app renders inside a phone-sized frame so the layout can be reviewed from a laptop.

To use the local API-backed trade check:

```bash
cd ..
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
uvicorn api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## Main Navigation

- Home: account snapshot, quick actions, latest journal note, and paths into the deeper tools.
- Search: ticker entry plus sector, market-cap, and event focus from the user's profile.
- Check: the raised center action for running an educational risk check.
- Alerts: behavior and risk reminders.
- Profile: local demo account, preferences, and sign out.

Report, Journal, Growth, Arena, and Learn are still in the app, but they now sit behind Home or the Check flow instead of crowding the bottom bar.

## Current behavior

- First open starts at an account home page instead of the trading workflow.
- Users can create a local demo account, sign in, request a demo password reset, persist a session, and sign out from Profile.
- Demo accounts are stored locally on the device/browser for prototype review.
- The bottom navigation uses a five-item finance-app layout with a raised center risk-check action.
- Check form values are editable.
- Check This Trade generates a report from the current form state.
- Trade checks call the local FastAPI endpoint when it is running and fall back to demo scoring when it is offline.
- Save to Journal adds the current report to the journal for this session.
- Journal entries persist locally across refreshes.
- Growth reads from journal entries and falls back to sample metrics when needed.
- Arena shows the options-agent replay as an educational experiment.
- The first-run disclaimer frames the app as educational risk review only.

## Notes

- No backend is required for this prototype.
- No trade execution is included.
- Language is framed as educational risk/context, not financial advice.
